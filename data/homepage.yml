        Absolutely AMAZING! I can't say enough great things about Elise. She's a truly gifted teacher and healer. I had back surgery a year and a half ago, and have had some residual problems and limitations. With **her strong knowledge base and years of experience**, Elise has been tremendously helpful to me. She is thorough, gentle, intuitive, caring and talented.

        Qi Gong for me is like **moving meditation**. It brings calmness and gently keeps my entire body supple and in balance. The more I practise, the more I am able to refine my movement, quieten my mind and be sensitive to my changing body's needs. These are all important tools which has helped me through my pregnancy.
