        Absolutely AMAZING! I cannot say enough great things about Elise Johnson. She is a truly  gifted teacher and healer. I had back surgery a year and a half ago, and have had some residual problems and limitations. With her strong knowledge base and years of experience, Elise has been tremendously helpful to me. She is thorough, gentle,  intuitive,  caring and quite talented. With the pandemic, I have been taking online Qi Gong classes, and it’s like having her here in my living room. She is perceptive and able to guide my practice precisely, and to a higher level. Recently, we did a zoom instructional on Gua Sha facials, and I’m beginning to see some improvements in my skin texture and vitality! Elise Johnson is a rare gem - I assure you, you will love working with her!

        I have been attending a weekly Qi Gong classes since last September.
        When I found out I was pregnant, I continued my practice as I knew it was beneficial to me.
        When I found out Elise was hosting virtual Qi going during the lockdown I decided to sign up for it.
        Qi Gong for me is like a moving meditation. Bring calmess and gently keep entire body supple and in balance. I also noticed that more I practice more I was able to refine my move, quietening mind and be sensitive to my needs for my changing body.
        These are all important tools which has helped me through my pregnancy.  I am 30 weeks pregnant now and planning to continue my Qi Gong practice all the way through to my labour.
