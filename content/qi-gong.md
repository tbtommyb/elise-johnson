Elise has been teaching Qi Gong classes since 1988, initially at the Shiatsu College and elsewhere in London and since she has been holding classes in Chelmsford.  Qi Gong is similar to Tai Chi but easier to learn.  Qi Gong uses slow, graceful movements combined with controlled breathing to promote circulation of Qi (energy) within the body to produce a sense of calmness and well-being.  It works on every joint in the body improving balance, flexibility and the immune system.  Qi Gong is for all ages and loose- fitting clothing and non-slip socks are the only equipment required.
