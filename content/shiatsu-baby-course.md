The Shiatsu baby massage routine is performed on babies from 6 weeks old upwards and promotes bonding and well-being, while relaxing babies, mums, dads, and carers. Alongside traditional massage techniques, we work with meridians and acupressure points to help with issues around digestion such as colic, wind, constipation, diarrhoea, teething difficulties, sleep, rashes (including nappy rash) and chest congestion.

Besides which it is fun and enjoyable to do! We have time at the end of the session to have a chat and share experiences or pickup tips. There is a Chinese saying “treat the mother to treat the child”: these group sessions have been found to be very supportive to the mother’s general well-being also.

Sessions are about 45mins to an hour and are on the following dates:
Tuesdays Aug 4th, 11th, 18th, 25th from 9:45 to 10:45am
Thursdays Aug 6th,13th,20th,27th from  3:30 to 4:30pm

You can choose 4 days from the above sessions.

Cost: £40 (paid in advance). To reserve your place a £20 non-refundable deposit by bank transfer is required.
