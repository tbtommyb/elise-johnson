The British Acupuncture Council has given clinics permission to reopen provided they follow Careful Practice. I’m looking forward to giving you great care and will be following stringent hygiene measures to keep us all safe:

* The clinic has been deep-cleaned and will be disinfected between each patient. All surfaces and contact points will be cleaned and couch covers, pillowcases and blankets changed.
* Before your session I will ask you to consent to treatment and to confirm that you have not been in contact with anyone with Covid-19.
* I will wash my hands regularly and on arrival ask you to do the same. I will take your temperature and provide you with a mask if you don’t have your own.
* I will be wearing a mask, visor and uniform with a plastic disposable apron throughout the session.

So things will look a little different for a while but it will be the same attentive, personal care attuned to your needs. Please contact me to arrange a consultation.

Clinic sessions are offered only at my Colchester clinic, 155 Turner Rd Co4 5XW.
Appointments available Afternoons from 12 30 pm to early evening.   Fee £55
Acupuncture has roots in China where it is part of mainstream healthcare and a stand-alone therapy also.  It is used all over the world and steadily increasing in popularity in the UK.

Membership of the British Acupuncture Council ( BAcC) ensures essential standard of practice are adhered to.   BAcC members practise acupuncture based on principles that have been developed, researched and refined for over 2000 years.

Acupuncture can be used for pain conditions such as arthritic joints and  back pain as well as other reasons such as people who feel  generally unwell but have no obvious diagnosis.

During a session a full case history is taken and pulses and tongue are examined in order to help make a decision for an individual treatment plan.

Needles are pre-sterilised, pre-packaged , used once and then safely disposed of . If necessary a referral to your GP or another health care practitioner would take place.

Shiatsu is a hands-on physical therapy that supports the body’s natural ability to balance itself.  It originates from Japan but its roots are from Traditional Chinese Medicine.  Literally, Shiatsu means ‘finger pressure’ but a shiatsu practitioner uses palms, hands, elbows and thumbs to stimulate meridians (pathways of energy) through loose fitting clothes to balance energy flow in the body.  It is a very deeply relaxing experience and regular treatments decrease stress and maintain a healthy immune system and support well being.
