The British Acupuncture Council has given clinics permission to reopen provided they follow Careful Practice. I’m looking forward to giving you great care and will be following stringent hygiene measures to keep us all safe:

* The clinic has been deep-cleaned and will be disinfected between each patient. All surfaces and contact points will be cleaned and couch covers, pillowcases and blankets changed.
* Before your session I will ask you to consent to treatment and to confirm that you have not been in contact with anyone with Covid-19.
* I will wash my hands regularly and on arrival ask you to do the same. I will take your temperature and provide you with a mask if you don’t have your own.
* I will be wearing a mask, visor and uniform with a plastic disposable apron throughout the session.

So things will look a little different for a while but it will be the same attentive, personal care attuned to your needs. Please contact me to arrange a consultation.

Clinic sessions are offered only at my Colchester clinic, 155 Turner Rd Co4 5XW.
Appointments available Afternoons from 12 30 pm to early evening.   Fee £55
