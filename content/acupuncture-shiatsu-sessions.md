# Acupuncture
Acupuncture can be used for pain conditions such as arthritic joints and back pain as well as other reasons such as people who feel generally unwell but have no obvious diagnosis.

During a session Elise takes a full case history and examines you pulse and tongue to help make your individual treatment plan. Needles are pre-sterilised, pre-packaged, used once and then safely disposed of.

# Shiatsu
Shiatsu is a hands-on, physical therapy that supports the body’s natural ability to balance itself. It originates from Japan but its roots are from Traditional Chinese Medicine. Elise uses her palms, hands, elbows and thumbs to stimulate meridians (pathways of energy) to balance energy flow in the body. It's deeply relaxing and regular treatments decrease stress, maintain a healthy immune system and support general well-being.
